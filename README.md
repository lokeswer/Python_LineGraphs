# Python_LineGraphs
This would be first code for a class project in Data analytics with Python!


In this project, I was assigned as a data analyst for an online lime retailer called Sublime Limes. 
People all over the world can use this product to get the freshest, best-quality limes delivered to their door. 
One of the product managers at Sublime Limes would like to gain insight into the customers and their sales habits. 
Using Matplotlib, I created some different line graphs (or maybe, lime graphs) to communicate this information effectively.
